# Reaction paper to Alan Turing’s “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” (1950).

Alan Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" introduces key ideas that have shaped the development of artificial intelligence. His "Imitation Game" is a practical thought experiment where a human tries to tell the difference between a human and a machine, bringing up the core question: Can machines think? 
Turing presents his arguments clearly and addresses possible objections. One example is the "Lady Lovelace Objection," which claims machines can only do what they are programmed to do. Turing argues that humans are also constrained by their biological makeup, making the distinction less clear. 
Even though Turing's paper is foundational, the definition of "thinking" is still debated today. What counts as intelligence, and how do we measure it? While Turing's ideas offer a strong foundation, it's obvious that more research is needed to fully understand both human and machine intelligence.
